				<h1> My Darling from Afar </h1>
				<h2> By Pauleen Gella B. Torralba </h2>
				<h3> This time of day brings me great dismay </h3>
				<h3> Unexpectedly, a gust of wind hits me on my face </h3>
				<h3> Making my tired eyes suddenly jolt awake </h3>
				<h3> And from a certain distance, there I see his lovely face </h3>
				<h3> It makes me think back to all those times </h3>
				<h3> Where I admired him from close behind </h3>
				<h3> I painted all those memories in the depths of my mind, not wanting a glimpse of it left behind </h3>
				<h3> I want him to help me piece together the puzzle of my fate, trusting his hands to guide the way </h3>
				<h3> For all that I am missing right now is the final piece, to complete the future in store for me </h3>
				<h3> Darling, can't you see that you're the last piece I need? </h3>
				<h3> I hope he can say the same to me </h3>
				<h3> For time is golden, and so is he </h3>
